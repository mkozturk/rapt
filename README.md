# RAPT: A Python framework for tracing relativistic test particles in general electromagnetic fields

RAPT (Rice Adaptive Particle Tracer) is an object-oriented package for simulating trajectories of charged particles under electric and magnetic fields. It is intended to be used for plasma physics research and education.

RAPT has the following features that make it a generally useful:

* Relativistic.
* Complete particle, guiding center, and bounce-averaged trajectories.
* Automatic switching between particle and guiding-center trajectories for efficiency.
* Accurate, state-of-the-art equations for the guiding center.
* Static or time-dependent fields.
* Easy to extend with new field models.
* Field-line tracing.
* Utilites to evaluate particle-related or field-line related quantities.
* Modular, object-oriented design for easy maintenance and extension.
